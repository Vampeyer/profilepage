Project should be complete so I will now follow suit with a Code Louisville 
Project Requirement Checklist 

* Visually appealing , 
project has custom photos , links and a "smooth" and "Stylish " text accordingly 

* Include a minimun of 2 media Queries , - Im not even going to reference this as my code is littered with them .   Media queries are an interesting feature for a number of uses and helped me kind of relate to jquery and learning that.  

* github repository with at least 5 commits , 
     - I have committed a lot and working with git is both a tool to have to learn , and super helpful for version control.  -  -  - I need mainstream merging lessons. - -  - but great tool to use and learn. 
     
* CSS requirements ,  - nav menu and flexbox.   added some other stuff. 

* Java script requirements ,    
    If you noticed i named myself a variable of student and looking in the console you will se I have passed my name in as a variable to create a console that says I passed this requirement,   I definintly need some more javascript practices and comfortability.  
    Great language to learn , very interesting.  
    - I need to see more examples of inputting variables and regular javascript code in such .
