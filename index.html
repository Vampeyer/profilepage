                <p> As I am  DJ in a band I also am working on developing a website for it. </p>

                <p> Plans for the website will consist of products , display , and overall showcasing of artistic talent.      </p>

                <h3>Project #2 ,  Enviro Securus </h3>

                <p>  this is an enviromentally fowards initiative I have been at work at for a long time. This is why I learned web dev1 and ANY developer looking to collab for ownership is welcome. 
                  at this time. Enviro Securus seeks to profitize the carbon tax market and bring re-fi to reality. As well as properly assist the transparency of carbon taxes , In a Re-fi and De-fi application.   By acting as an accountant for decarbonization taxes, 
                   <p> Enviro Securus is the first of its kind in climate technology. Applying the most effective and realistic results possible.
                     Further Details will be released 
                    upon development completion.  </p>

                <h3> Project# 3  Code Louisville Support Page    </h3>

                <p> I have a ridiculously large and somewhat assorted array of differtent code and pages of HTML and CSS , 
                    but mainly in JavaScript and etc.  I plan on creating a web-page that has neatly organized code references for future web-development 1 students. 
                 I want them to be able to reference code easier and faster ,and use it more early on at an easier outlet. I think this will lead to more retention rates and a 
                 higher student passing average.    - like a MDN docs catering to web-dev one students. -  </p>
